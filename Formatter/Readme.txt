This program formats a headline according to the rules below:

1. Capitalize nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions. If a word is hyphenated, every part of the word should be capitalized (e.g., "Self-Reflection" not "Self-reflection").
2. Capitalize the first and the last word.
3. Lowercase all other parts of speech: articles, coordinating conjunctions, prepositions, particles, interjections.
